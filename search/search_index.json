Current Update (4/30) \u00b6 Product (and consignor) onboarding Wishlist management and updates , including sectional pre-ordering Next Steps / Issues to address \u00b6 Email Integration with Quickbooks for accounting Previous Status (4/24) \u00b6 The Tacoma Consignment team is already underway with the transition to a Shopify-driven website. When the site is working, the Wordpress site will be decommissioned. (RC is poised to make the relevant domain changes when ready) In addition, the team will transition the POS system to Shopify POS . This will enable a single back end for both in-store and online sales, as well as a single source of product truth. Decisions to date \u00b6 Shopify Shopify POS Shopify CRM Domain management by RC No more Wordpress Quickbooks export via app or workflow (see below) [Active] Product (and consignor) onboarding and management (updated 4/30) \u00b6 Alert This is an active proposal for your consideration Based on an interview with Lindsey on 4/28, it is assumed that all consignors accept the same base 50/50 contract independent of any product price or type. The core negotiation around product submissions thus consists of setting the base price of the product on the floor. Both parties must agree to this price (and the consignor sign an agreement to that effect) for the SKU to be created in the system. The swimlane diagram below shows three \"actors\": a consignor submitting an item Lindsey the Shopify POS / CRM system Processes are rectangles, decisions diamonds, and other processes other shapes that are hopefully self-describing. The diagram currently shows an approval process where a product submission from an existing consignor is checked after the product is already approved. If it is important to know that a submission is from a known consignor, we can put that check in up front (it's originally how I drew it but I did not want to put any friction on the submission process; if you get overwhelmed by submissions that is a good filter/check to put in place) Proposed item submission approval workflow \u00b6 Recommendation Even though the current contract does not explicitly address discounting, we recommend a standard discounting schedule be pursued to facilitate inventory turnover as well as enable wishlist alerts for interested online followers of products [Active] Wishlist features and management \u00b6 Wishlist features are already built into Shopify at the product level, however the real challenge of the current process is the manual, paper-based process for tracking and following up with customers. More discussion on the existing process is necessary to understand how to properly manage the types of wishlist capabilities necessary, including how sectional pre-ordering may occur. General-purpose wishlist request flow \u00b6 Note This process can work for sectional ordering as well Product discount-schedule-based wishlist flow \u00b6 Key Links \u00b6 Power automate connectors Jotform Google calendar Mailchimp Shopify [Upcoming] Email \u00b6 Depending on decisions about Outlook and CRM, email configuration will follow. CRM \u00b6 Recommendation Use Shopify CRM at least temporarily Whatever direction Tacoma Consignment is headed with consignor management, some kind of CRM system should be contemplated for long-term management of Tacoma Consignment's customers . With a single POS system and the entire TC catalog available online, multiple opportunities exist to build a more collaborative and insightful interaction with customers. Features such as wishlists and recommendations are tailor-made for interested customers to track activities and products they care about. Products that can be re-stocked can trigger emails to interested customers automatically when they come back into stock, for example. Depending on the CRM choice, other features may be possible as well, such as the automated SKU-onboarding flow previously discussed for Jotform; direct support in a CRM would be less expensive and more reliable than another fully decoupled app and subscription. In addition, it's conceivable, and in many ways desirable, to have a single CRM system for both consignors and customers. As is already known, many consignors are customers and there is reason to believe some TC's best customers are also its best consignors . Without a unified view of the people interacting with TC, it will be hard to pull that information out systematically and in a way that informs feature and product prioritization.
