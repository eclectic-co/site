# Tacoma Consignment

## Overview

[Tacoma Consignment](https://tacomaconsignment.com/) is a growing consignment store in downtown Tacoma. Started two years ago, they were exploring updating their payment systems to accommodate different payment methods such as Apple Pay when our conversation began.

After a series of interviews with management and staff it became clear that, while successful and growing, all the disjoint processes of managing clients, consignors, and deliveries are creating a lot of strain.

## Goals

The core intent of this project is to systematize the merchandise intake and SKU creation workflow to simplify the organization, merchandizing, sales, consignor payments, and logistics processes.

In addition, though, one process critical to the success and aesthetic of Tacoma Consignment is better recognition and incorporation of the *design process* the owners apply to evaluating and organizing the products in the showroom and, potentially, for sale online.  Products are organized into stylistic groupings in the store, and inbound product inquiries are evaluated by how well they fit within the different design sensibilities on offer. 

Fundamentally, however, because the [current POS implementation](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/oa/point-of-sale/) is principally focussed on in-store transactions, the opportunities for collection-based merchandising possible with online systems are not leveraged as much as they might be.

## Current Core Workflow


![Tacoma Consignment Current Workflow](assets/images/Tacoma%20Consignment%20Current%20Workflow.png)

### Quickbooks POS

  * SKU creation
  * Sales
  * Bookkeeping / accounting

### Ability Business Systems

  * Consignor Payments

### Wordpress website

The [tacomaconsignment.com website](https://tacomaconsignment.com) is based on a [Wordpress CMS](https://builtwith.com/tacomaconsignment.com). While WooCommerce plug-ins and product- and cateogyry-page displays are supported, commerce is not. Social links are enabled at the site level and point at the Tacoma Consignment accounts rather than enabling product- or page-level sharing.

## Recommended Approach

Tacoma Consignment had independently been considering Shopify as an option for online sales. We wholeheartedly support this. 


### [Jotform](https://jotform.com) forms-based intake workflow

  * [product image submissions](https://www.jotform.com/widgets/category/photo), including classifications for collections
  * dislosures and assertions (e.g. no smells or stains, etc.)
  * [contract / terms acceptance](https://www.jotform.com/form-templates/category/consent-forms) and [digital signature](https://www.jotform.com/pdf-templates/search?q=digital+signature)   
  * [custom-generated printable contract PDF](https://www.jotform.com/pdf-templates/new-pdf)
  * acceptance and rejection workflows

#### (optional) Consignor account creation
  * dashboard to track their submitted inventory, sales
  * (see below) points for retail redemption
* Shopify-based SKU creation

### Shopify POS and commerce-enabled website

#### [Consignor reimbursement via Shopify Extension](https://apps.shopify.com/search?q=vendor+payments)

#### [Quickbooks export via Shopify Extension](https://apps.shopify.com/search?q=quickbooks)

## Other Options

* Integration with CRM Systems
* Discount codes and promotions
* Points system for in-store credit / consignor sales
* Publish to third-party systems (Craigslist, ebay, OfferUp, etc.)

## Cost Estimation

| Service | Plan | Monthly  |  Notes |
| ---- | ---- | --- | ---- | 
| [Jotform](https://www.jotform.com/) | Bronze | $29 | Storage limit drives choice, assuming photo submission |
| [Shopify](https://shopify.com) | [Basic or standard](https://www.shopify.com/payments) [with POS](https://www.shopify.com/pos/features) | $29 / $79 | [Shopify Pro POS](https://www.shopify.com/pos/features) is an additional $89/month but offers *a lot* and should be considered (perhaps Basic plan + Pro POS?) |  
| Shopify Extensions | n/a | $15-30 per extension | many different options; worth researching | 
| **Total** |  | ***$100-260*** | at $190+ level serious functionality enabled |
